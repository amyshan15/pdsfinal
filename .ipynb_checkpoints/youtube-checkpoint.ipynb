    "Created by three former PayPal employees in 2005 and later acquired in 2006 by Google, YouTube has tranformed from a simple video hosting service into the world's largest entertainment platform. A community for creators everywhere, YouTube has proven able to support its creators financially as well through Google's targeted advertising program AdSense, and people are using that to quit their jobs and focus on their YouTube channels as a full-time career. In fact, in an age where anyone can pick up their phones and start a vlog, the question of what makes a YouTube channel successful is hotly debated. Today, we'll be looking at channels across several genres (lifestyle, food & travel, gaming, beauty & fashion) to get an idea of what being a successful YouTuber looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q: What does a successful YouTube channel look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "To break this down even further, we're going to answer this question by carrying out the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Dataset Assembly](#1.-Dataset-Assembly)\n",

    "3. [Model Training](#3.-Model-Training)\n",

    "## 1. Dataset Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "To assemble our dataset, we're going to query the YouTube Data API's search function for our genres (lifestyle, food & travel, gaming, beauty & fashion). Before we do this, however, it would be helpful to define the 3 major types of channels we expect to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Channel Types\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popular\n",
    "\n",
    "A **popular** channel has popular videos (large view/video count), a large following (large subscriber count), and an active community (buzzing comment section) around it. Popular channels may not necessarily have the highest view count per video, but accumulate views through consistent content release and the community around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Growing\n",
    "\n",
    "A **growing** channel is like a popular channel except it only started gaining traction recently so its community activity may not be as consistent. Many channels with growing view counts and subscriber counts exist on YouTube, but the key distinction for the growing channels we've defined is the consistency of its content release schedules since channels only become popular if they engage their audience consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Small\n",
    "\n",
    "A **small** channel is lesser known within the YouTube community. It generally has low view counts and subscriber counts relative to popular and growing channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the motivation behind asking our question, consider music as a genre on YouTube. Vevo is a music video hosting service that partners with huge records labels like the Warner Music Group, and as a part of their contracts, Vevo helps artists like Eminem and Rihanna manage their YouTube channels. As we've defined above, channels like EminemVEVO and RihannaVEVO would be considered **popular** channels, but their success is largely derived from the artists' success in the music industry and other platforms like Spotify. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we're not extremely interested in investigating what makes these YouTube channels successful because we suspect that a big part of their success is independent of the YouTube channels themselves. That's why we're not considering music as a genre when we're assembling this dataset and why we're not looking into other genres like late night talk shows because most of them present the same confounding variables that influence the success of their channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### YouTube Data API\n",
    "\n",
    "For querying the YouTube database, we'll be using the YouTube Data API. Here is a link to its official documentation: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we're interested in using a method called **search: list**, which will allow us to query the database with parameters like keywords, location, etc. More information about this method can be found here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by instantiating an object that establishes an authenticated connection to the YouTube Data Api."

    "**Popular**: Cluster 3 (red) and Cluster 0 (blue) contain our most popular channels. These channels have lots of subscribers and their channels have consistently high engagement. Examples include: CaseyNeistat, Gigi Gorgeous, RomanAtwoodVlogs, and Epic Meal Time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Growing**: Cluster 4 (purple) and Cluster 1 (orange) contain our channels with average popularity. These channels have fewer subsrcibers than the two above, but still have good audience engagement. Examples include: AlishaMarieVlogs, iJustine, Vlogs by DK4L, and Bon Appetit.\n",

    "**Small Channels**: Cluster 2 (green) contains our smallest channels. These channels have low engagement from their audience. Examples include: LevelCapGaming, Beauty Tricks, and Jamie Oliver."

    "In this project we did not consider the differences achieving popularity across different genres. In the future we look to analyze each genre separately to reduce the effects of any confounding variables across genres.\n",

    "When we queried the YouTube Data API, it was inherently biased towards larger channels because they sorted in descending order on the metrics we specified in our parameters. Therefore, it might be helpful to webscrape for smaller channels for more variety in channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Youtube Data API does not record historical data, but we could assemble our own, which could useful to characterize growth, for example, of a channel. This is most likely what SocialBlade, a YouTube analytics platform, utilizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although KMeans++ is very easy to implement, the accuracy of its clusters relies on spherically distributed clusters, similar variance across clusters, etc. Thus, it could be beneficial to examine the performance of other clustering algorithms like GMM and hierarchical clustering to see what yields the lowest error values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we were initially interested in training a sentiment analysis model to analyze video captions. We ultimately decided against it because we found that captions across even one channel's videos were highly variable. Thus, we avoided it for the purposes of this project but that could be something else to look into when expanding on our feature set."
