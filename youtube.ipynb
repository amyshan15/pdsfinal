    "Created by three former PayPal employees in 2005 and later acquired in 2006 by Google, YouTube has tranformed from a simple video hosting service into the world's largest entertainment platform. A community for creators everywhere, YouTube has proven able to support its creators financially as well through Google's targeted advertising program AdSense, and people are using that to quit their jobs and focus on their YouTube channels as a full-time career. In fact, in an age where anyone can pick up their phones and start a vlog, the question of what makes a YouTube channel successful is hotly debated. Today, we'll be looking to characterize different types of channels (popular, growing, declining) across several genres (lifestyle, food & travel, gaming, beauty & fashion) to get an idea of what being a successful YouTuber looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q: What does a successful YouTube channel look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "To break this down even further, we're going to answer this question by carrying out the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dataset Assembly\n",
    "2. Feature Extraction\n",
    "3. Feature Visualization\n",
    "4. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Without further ado, let's begin!"

   "source": [
    "## 1. Dataset Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "To assemble our dataset, we're going to query the YouTube Data API's search function for our genres (lifestyle, food & travel, gaming, beauty & fashion) and filter the data returned for our 3 types of channels. But in order to do that, we're have to first define what characterizes these types so we know how to filter the data for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Channel Types\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popular\n",
    "\n",
    "A **popular** channel has popular videos (view count), a large following (subscriber count), and active community (comment section). In addition, consistency is also extremely important because it measures the ability of the channel to engage its followers so channels that post a few viral videos are not popular by our definition. Popular channels may not necessarily have the highest view count per video, but accumulate views through consistent content release and the community around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Growing\n",
    "\n",
    "A **growing** channel is like a popular channel except it only started gaining traction recently so its community activity may not be as consistent. Many channels with growing view counts and subscriber counts exist on YouTube, but the key distinction for the growing channels we've defined is the consistency of its content release schedule. Like we mentioned earlier, channels only become popular if they engage their audience consistently and publish content on a regular basis so we'll be filtering for that when we identify growing channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Declining\n",
    "\n",
    "A **declining** channel may have a large subscriber count, but its view count is falling steadily and its comment sections may be less active than they were before. In general, channels decline when they don't stick to content release schedules and fail to engage their audiences, but we're interested in knowing why certain channels that do publish content regularly still fail. That's why we'll focus on again on channels that publish content consistently to see what other features come into play here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Now that we've defined the 3 types of channels we're looking for, assembling the dataset will be a much smoother process. However, it is also important to consider additional filters in order to guarantee that we answer our question above in the most meaningful way possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the motivation behind asking our question, consider music as a genre on YouTube. Vevo is a music video hosting service that partners with huge records labels like the Warner Music Group, and as a part of their contracts, Vevo helps artists like Eminem and Rihanna manage their YouTube channels. As we've defined above, channels like EminemVEVO and RihannaVEVO would be considered **popular** channels, but their success is largely derived from the artists' success in the music industry and other platforms like Spotify. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we're not extremely interested in investigating what makes these YouTube channels successful because we suspect that a big part of their success is independent of the YouTube channels themselves. That's why we're not considering music as a genre when we're assembling this dataset and why we're not looking into other genres like late night talk shows because most of them present the same confounding variables that influence the success of their channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### YouTube Data API\n",
    "\n",
    "For querying the YouTube database, we'll be using the YouTube Data API. Here is a link to its official documentation: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we're interested in using a method called **search: list**, which will allow us to query the database with parameters like keywords, location, etc. More information about this method can be found here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by instantiating an object that establishes an authenticated connection to the YouTube Data Api."

    "#### Other Features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Community Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we identified a channel's community as an important metric in measuring its popularity, and a channel's comment section best reflects this. However, the YouTube API does not return an accurate comment count per channel, so we will query each channels last 20 videos to get an idea of how active the channel's comment sections for each of those videos are.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Content Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, our sampling targets consistent uploaders because we assume that the uploader is active so we will use these videos to look for how far apart the dates between uploads are on average. If this average is greater than a week, we can conclude that the channel is not a consistent uploader.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Growth Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "To also characterize whether a channel is growing or declining, we will use the channel's percentage change in view counts across these videos. For example, a percent change of over 20% and under -20% might be labeled as growing and declining respectively, and anything between that will be labeled as a possibly popular channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Favorability\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, each video has a statistics on the number of likes and dislikes, which is the only venue through which users can give direct binary feedback on the content uploaders post. Other methods for classifying how people feel rely on analyzing the sentiment of the comments section via NLP methods, and due to high variability we will not be covering that in this notebook. Thus, the higher the ratio of likes to dislikes, the more favorable these videos are as well."
